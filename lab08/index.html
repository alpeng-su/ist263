            <h1>Alexis Peng's Biography</h1>

            <p>
            My name is Alexis Peng. I am a <strong>public relations</strong> major with a double minor in information management and technology and sociology. I am interested in branding and social media strategy in the corporate and entertainment industries. My extracurricular activities include Hill Communications, PRSSA, and University 100. I am also in a multicultural sorority called alpha Kappa Delta Kappa Phi International Sorority Inc.

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my younger sister. Both my parents are immigrants from Taiwan. 
            <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy sewing or singing. I also love watching movies with my family. Some of my favorites include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Departed</li>
                <li>Sleepers</li>
                <li>Serendipity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Since I was young, my mom had movies that she wanted to show my sister and me. This created my interest in film and the entertainment industry.
