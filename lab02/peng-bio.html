        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my younger sister. Both my parents are immigrants from Taiwan. 
         <br>
            In my free time, I enjoy sewing or singing. I also love watching movies with my family. Some of my favorites include:

            <li>The Departed</li>
            <li>Sleepers</li>
            <li>Serendipity</li>
         </ul>

        <p>
         Since I was young, my mom had movies that she wanted to show my sister and me. This created my interest in film and the entertainment industry.
