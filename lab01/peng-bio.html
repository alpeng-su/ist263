    <body>
    My name is Alexis Peng. I am a public relations major with a double minor in information management and technology and sociology. I am interested in branding and social media strategy in the corporate and entertainment industries.
	In my free time, I enjoy sewing or singing. I also enjoy watching classic movies with my family. Since I was young, my mom had movies that she wanted to show my sister and me. This created my interest in film and the entertainment industry.
