        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            College can be a confusing and stressful time. We are on our own dealing with school work, social lives, homesickness--all while trying to take care of ourselves.

            My name is Alexis. I am a sophomore at Syracuse University and I am studying public relations with a double minor in information management and technology and sociology. As I am juggling my academics, extracurriculars, and social life at college, I want to create this platform to share my tips and experiences to connect with other college students going through the same thing.
