                    <h3>"Starting Off the Semester Strong"</h3>
                    <p>
                        The beginning of the semester can be hectic as you prepare for the semester ahead. Sylli week--while is chill and is the calm before the storm--is THE time to prepare for you next steps. Something I do from the start is read the syllabus. I know, a lot of it is redundant, but it is the best way to see what is ahead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I live and breathe my Google calendar. After I have gotten all my syllabi for my courses, I blast some of my favorite music and put every assignment and exam in that calendar. It takes an hour or two and it makes sure that I don’t forget any assignments later in the semester and I have my months ahead laid out in front of me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use your sylli week to catch up with friends, adjust, AND prepare for your time ahead. This simple step will make your time management less of a headache later.

                    <h3>"Finding Your People"</h3>
                    <p>
                        In college, you are going to be surrounded by a variety of people with different perspectives and experiences. You’re starting new and it can be hard to know how to make new friends and build new relationships. My best tip is to meet a variety of people and experience all the different groups of people and see what sticks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my freshman year, I limited myself to a single group of friends from my floor. While it was nice for a time, when it got to the point when I realized they weren’t the people that I wanted to surround myself with, I felt trapped because I had limited myself to only socializing with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Freshman year is a time when everyone around you is at square one and is looking to meet more people. Use that time to branch out of your comfort zone, don’t limit yourself and meet everyone. You’ll soon find the right group that you want around all the time.

                    <h3>"Combatting Homesickness"</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my first semester at college, I definitely had a time when I missed home. This was the first time that I was away from my family for an extended period of time and I found myself missing the little charms of my hometown that I didn’t recognize before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I live about 3 hours away from home by car, so I never really wanted to make the trip to visit home and, now with the pandemic, it can be harder to visit home. How do you combat it? Here are some tips that my friends and I used:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Call your family - While we are going off and being independent, it’s important to keep in contact with your roots. Have one day each week or every 2 weeks when you call your parents and siblings to see how they are doing and to check in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reach out to your non-college friends - Sometimes all you need is people who will make you feel like you are back home. Your friends from back home might have all gone to different places for college. Reach out and catch up with them. It’s a great way to keep up with them and to connect with people who understand the life you had pre-college.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep yourself busy - I went farther away for college to experience new things and to make some memories for myself. While it can be hard when you miss being at home, it helps to live in the moment and make the most of your time away from home. I am constantly making plans with friends and keeping myself busy with extracurriculars to distract myself and make the most out of my college experience.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These are the main three things that my friends and I use when we are missing home. Do you have other ways to feel less homesick? Head to the Connect page to share.
